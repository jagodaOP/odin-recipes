    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cevapi are the national grilled meat specialty and one of the most famous Bosnian brands. Specifically, the most familiar is the cevapi from Sarajevo. Cevap (pronounced tche-vaap) represent a piece of grilled minced meat, something like a meat dumpling, but in an elongated shape. In this post, I’ll share with you my traditional Bosnian cevapi recipe.
Many restaurants in Sarajevo translate cevapi as “minced meat fingers” as they look like that. The average length of cevap is two inches. The portions you can get are five, 10 and 15 cevapi, served in special bread called somun. It resembles pita bread, but much softer and sprinkled with black sesame seeds.</p>
