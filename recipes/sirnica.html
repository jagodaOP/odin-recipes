    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Do you want to enjoy a delicious meal and delight your family or friends with the food they haven’t tasted before? Then this recipe is for you.
        Two slices of Bosnian Cheese Pita Sirnica on a plate.
        This is a tasty, easy to cook, airy dish. And I’m talking about Bosnian Cheese Pita (so-called Sirnica) or a simple name for it will be a cheese pie with phyllo pastry.
        You can find different traditional names for Sirnica. It all depends on the filling.
        And there are a lot of types of fillings such as cherries, meat, herbs, potatoes, or pumpkin.
        The traditional Sirnica is only with cottage cheese. For those that are obsessed with cheeses (like me), I would recommend trying this recipe with additional mozzarella. Also, you can add other types of cheeses that you like. A good fit will be the Feta cheese.
        This puff pie will surprise you because it is unique in its simplicity, but you will get excited by how tasty it is.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb (450 grams) of Cottage Cheese.</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix well all the ingredients.</li>
        <li>After that, you have to fill the phyllo sheets with the filling and roll them. Check below all the necessary steps on how to do that.</li>
        <li>After that, take a brush and spread evenly all the remaining butter over the entire surface of the pie.</li>
        <li>Optionally, for extra taste and texture, you can add your favorite seeds. In my case, I used sesame, flax, pumpkin, and sunflower seeds.</li>

        <li>When the pie becomes well browned, it is ready to be served.</li>
